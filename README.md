## Project UNES

### ðŸª§Description

My first project was to build a simple website for a fantasy university using HTML 5. The website contained three pages:

- `index.html` - the main page
- `about_us` - descriptions about the university and the courses
- `contact` - contact page with a single form (no back-end)
